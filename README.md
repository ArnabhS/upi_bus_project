*Problem Statement*


 Outdated systems relying on cash and paper tickets contribute to inefficiencies, longer transaction times, and inconvenience for passengers. The absence of modern, digital payment options further hinders efficiency and accessibility, as passengers face challenges in making cashless transactions. Security concerns arising from reliance on traditional methods underscore the need for a more secure payment infrastructure to protect both passengers and the transportation system from fraud and theft. In addition, the current fare calculation methods often lack transparency, leading to unfair pricing systems. The limited user convenience resulting from the absence of a user-friendly interface and integration with modern technologies, such as mobile apps, further discourages potential passengers. These challenges collectively contribute to a suboptimal public transportation experience. To address these issues, a comprehensive strategy involves implementing contactless payment systems, developing user-friendly mobile apps, enhancing security measures, introducing dynamic fare calculations, promoting education, collaborating with technology providers, upgrading infrastructure, collecting user feedback, and securing government support and regulations. Through these measures, public transportation can offer a more efficient and secure experience, encouraging widespread adoption of digital payment systems.
